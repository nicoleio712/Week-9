# Week 9 - Honeypots

> Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Honeypots deployed: 
mhn-honeypot-1

## Issues Encountered:
I actually found that the export was one of the trickiest part of the assignment. I ended up having to go into the Google Cloud Console to open a terminal from there which wasn't super intuitive. Also, the installation of the firewall was troublesome in that I had to wait for the gcloud Compute Engine to load completely before the terminal commands would execute properly. That troubleshooting tip should probably be included in the future.

## Summary of Data:

**number attacks:** 110 (in 6 hours on 4/12)

**attack stats:**

## Unresolved Questions:

Some attacks didn't have a country of origin, which was pretty strage -- I thought that might mean the attack was pretty strong and capable of concealing its origin. I also saw that the most attacked port was port 23 (189 attacks in 3 days), but I'm not sure if there was a reason for that or if it was just statistics.
